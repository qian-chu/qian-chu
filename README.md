My name is Qian CHU (褚乾) from Shanghai, China. I'm a first-year PhD student at the Max Planck - University of Toronto Centre for Neural Science and Technology, advised by [Lucia Melloni](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/people/lucia-melloni-en.html) and [Taufik Valiante](https://surgery.utoronto.ca/faculty/taufik-valiante) of the Max Planck Society and University of Toronto respectively. I received my BS in Neural Science from NYU Shanghai, where I worked with [Xing Tian](https://bcs.shanghai.nyu.edu/en/peoples/faculty-affiliates/xing-tian) on auditory imagery, prediction, and a causal inference account of agency.

I'm broadly interested in how biological and artificial forms of intelligence construct internal models of the external world and put them into critical use. I'm especially curious about neural computations associated with predictive signals (predictive coding vs. prior-incorporated estimation) and their laminar organization. I currently investigate visuomotor prediction in saccades and what role the medial temporal lobe (the "predictive", "cognitive" map) plays in it.
